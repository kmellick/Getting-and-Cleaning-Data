##Introduction
#####This Github repository includes script, Codebook, and averaged data for teh Getting and Cleaning Data Coursera Course project.
#####The averaged and compiled data were from the UCI Machine Learning Repository: Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Data Set.


####Instructions for the Data set are copied below from the Course Website(https://class.coursera.org/getdata-032)

######You should create one R script called run_analysis.R that does the following. 
1. Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
2. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement. 
3. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
4. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names. 
5. From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

###run_analysis.R
#####This is the script that carries out the instructions described above, in the manner described in the Code Book.
###tidyavgdata.txt
######This file includes the results from step 5 described above.
